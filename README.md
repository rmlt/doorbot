Software for our DoorBot

The DoorBot is a device connected to our doorphone that opens the office doors as required.

This software runs on a Raspberry Pi connected to a circuit board that allows it to:
* get input from the doorphone LED and the doorbell button
* simulate pressing a button on the doorphone
* move a servo attached to the door handle
* play sounds

TODO:
* black, isort
* split into modules
* logging instead of printing
* add some photos
